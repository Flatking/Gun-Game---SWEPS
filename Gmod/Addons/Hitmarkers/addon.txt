This addon works in BOTH singleplayer and multiplayer (only if the server has it installed) so there are no problems! Simply walk up to a player or NPC and shoot them to test out the hitmarkers, you should see them near your crosshairs and hear a sound confirming that you hit the guy. They are also color-configurable through a chat command or console command depending on what works for you. And if your favorite server has them and you dont like them then you can turn them off through a simple console command. So go get 25 kills and a Nuke!  [h1]*** FAQ:[/h1]  * Will this work in TTT? Yup! This works perfect in TTT and other gamemodes * Is this compatible with other hitmarker mods? It does work with others though its kinda redundant, Spec DM is one it does work with. * Is this "Cod-like Hitmarkers" or copied? Nope, all original code and differing functions beside the actual hitmarker. It is NOT stolen or copied  [h1]*** Config:[/h1]  * Console - hm_enabled 1/0 - Enables (1) or disables the hitmarkers, clientside. * Console - hm_hitmarkertype chosentype -  Changes your crosshair design between one of three seen in the picture above * Console - hm_hitmarkercolor r, g, b - This is the first method of changing your crosshair color using Red, Green, Blue color codes if you want something specific. * Chat - !hmcolor - The second and preferred method of changing color. Just type that in chat and a fancy panel will open up with a color mixer, just move the cursor onto your choice and hit the button!  [h1]*** Credits:[/h1]  * FusRoDoug and the Matrix Gaming community for allowing me to test this on there * IHazFail99 - Emotional support "
