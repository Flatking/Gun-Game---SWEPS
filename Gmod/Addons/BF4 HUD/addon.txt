The minimap has basic functions at the moment, I am planing on doing alot more with it.  Note:  The reload icon and the firemode switch indicator will not work for default HL2 weapons because of how they are setup Credits: Main Code: KatBug (ResidualGrub) Base Mini Map Code: Danny Amazing Art: lavadeeto  "
